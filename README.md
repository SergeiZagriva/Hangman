# Hangman

A hangman game with a clickable alphabet and a chance to get a hint. The game is capable of counting your score and keeping the highest gained score.

Later on, the high score feature can be improved to keep the id and name of players. This will introduce some sort of the multiplayer mode. The same feature can also be updated to have a working leaderboard. The server is set up and ready to serve features like the leaderboard.

Another big improvement that needs to be done is paying more attention to the server-side of the game. At the moment, the whole game is client-side, therefore functions like word picker are on the client-side which means that there are ways of cheating. 

To sum up, features that need to be updated/added in order to level up the overall quality of the game are:

1. Moving some functions to the server-side in order to avoid cheating
2. Design update
3. Multiplayer
4. Dictionary with more words
5. More hints or ability to hint a single letter
6. In-game money for hints


The application launches with "npm start" command.
